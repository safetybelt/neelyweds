    "True to our nerd roots, Jonathan and Stephanie met online and decided to meet in real life after exchanging enough messages to fill a novel.  Jonathan, as thoughtful and nervous as he could be, set a hard-stop time to end the date - just in case either person wanted to escape through a bathroom window.  Stephanie still brings this up on a weekly basis.",
    "Our first date was for drinks at Mad Oak on 9/11/2015. Bonding over Disney and drinking, the date ended going past the hard-stop time, though Stephanie did wonder if Jonathan had abandoned her while he waited in line for more drinks.  After a great first date, they made plans for the next full date.",
    "We won't go into details on every date, but it seems important to note Stephanie beat Jonathan in bowling on their 3rd date - which she also brings up anytime they are near a bowling alley.",
    "Starting off slow for the first few months, things quickly ramped up. From a weekend road trip with five adults and a dog in one car to Colorado, to a couple weeks traipsing around New Zealand in an RV with six adults, we haven't even gotten close to being tired of each other (or those stuck with us during those trips).",
    "In a weekend getaway to Disneyland, Jonathan popped the question. No, not in front of Cinderella's castle (like she expected). He waited for the perfect time, when they were walking through Tomorrowland, in the light rain, wearing newly purchased Star Wars gear.",
    "After checking if he was serious (he was), she happily accepted, realized why he'd been acting weird, and then got this gem on Hyperspace Mountain.",

    "We're excited to start the next step of our lives, wedding planning, and even more excited to be married."
