    "True to our nerd roots, Jonathan and Stephanie met online and decided to meet IRL after exchanging enough messages to fill a novel.",
    "Our first date was for drinks at Mad Oak on 9/11/2015 (yes, we know...who knew it’d get this far?). Bonding over Disney and drinking, they made plans for the next full date.",
    "We won’t go into details on every date, but it seems important to note Stephanie beat Jonathan in bowling on their 3rd date.",
    "Starting off slow for the first few months, things quickly heated up. From a weekend road trip with 5 adults + a dog in one car to Colorado, to a couple weeks traipsing around New Zealand in an RV with 6 adults, we’ve haven’t even gotten close to being tired of each other (or those stuck with us during those trips).",
    "In a weekend getaway to Disneyland, Jonathan popped the question. No, not in front of Cinderella’s castle. He waited for the perfect time, when they were walking through Tomorrowland, in the light rain, wearing newly purchased Star Wars gear.",
    "After checking if he was serious (he was), she happily accepted, realized why he’d been acting weird, and then got this gem on Hyperspace Mountain.",

    "We’re excited to start the next step of our lives, wedding planning, and even more excited to be married."
